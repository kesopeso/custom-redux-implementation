# custom-redux-implementation
This is a custom redux implementation using react hooks.

## Progress
Two hardcoded reducers are added to the main redux store.  
See index.tsx, StateStore.tsx and App.tsx for usage example.

### TODO
1. Abstract out two hardcoded reducers and make it generic.
2. Create a HOC component that emulates mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps.
